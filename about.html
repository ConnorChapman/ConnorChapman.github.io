        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Connor Chapman (that's me on the left) and thank you for visiting my portfolio. This website serves a couple purposes. First it is setup as a professional portfolio to showcase my front-end development skills. I will have links set-up to all the work that I have done on my main page. The second purpose of this site is to act as a testing stage for new technologies that I learn. I will implement new JS/jQuery skills that I learn while I am in the process of becoming a full-stack web developer.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to follow me on twitter my username is <a href = "https://twitter.com/chapmanwebdsgn">@chapmanwebdsgn</a>.</p>
